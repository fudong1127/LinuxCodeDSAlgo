# Datastructure, Algorithm, Design pattern
A collection of Datastructure, Algorithm, Design pattern.

## Goals
    Programming at work and Programming at home as a hobby are two different things,
this is my hobby,my second love (first love is my wife :) ). 
    There is so much more to coding then just pointers/refs/memory, 
its about the environment/editor/compiler/custom makefile, its not about getting your code to work,
but the entire journey that is to be cherished, there is no deadline, and no one to answer to.
its my arena, where i get to do what is love and do it the way i like it.
    So if you intend to use this work, you are most welcome (at you own risk :) ), i would be glad
if you report bugs/issues and point me to methods which are more efficient,it would indeed be a great 
learning curve.
